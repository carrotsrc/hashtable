This is a basic hash table unit and set of functions for working with table. Also included is an iterator for scanning through the hash table sequentually.
The hash table can store anything.

Overview
--------

The hash table consists of a array of buckets. When an item is added to the table, it's value is hashed and that is used to calculate the index of the bucket

A bucket can contain more than one item because sometimes there is an index collision from the hash; This is managed by a linked list in each bucket. Each item in the linked list has a key and a value which is some data that is associated with the item's key. So for instance:

["ACF" | 100]

or

[ 432  | "foobar"]

"ACF" is the key and 100 is the value, 423 is the key and "foobar" is the value associated. The value is not necessary and represents extra data; a data structure can be hashed and stored meaning no store is needed.

Data is retrieved from the table by passing whatever was used to hash the key. So in the above example get("ACF") is used to retrieve the associated 100.

The hash table can handle any sort of data, it just needs to be told which functions to use in order to hash the type of data has been passed to it, how to compare that type of data for retrieval purposes, how to store any associated data and how to free any associated data. The associated data is the value and is not necessary.

It is possible to iterate over the hash table sequentually, and so in a loop, using an iterator.


The hash table has been tested on a body of text with about 1.1 million words, resulting in about 50k keys


Building
--------

It design as a unit to slot into place but the object file can be compiled with:

gcc --std=c99 -c hash_table.c -o hash_table.o





Changelog
---------
- Made terminology conventional
- Correct freeing of hashed items including value
- Hash item free callback takes value that is hashed, as well as store as arguments
- Made local unit scope functions static
- Added iterator free function
- Added an iterator
- Fixed problem of btbucket_td not being in header file
- Typedef names do not use reserved POSIX naming conventions
